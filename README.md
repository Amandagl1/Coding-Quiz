# Coding-Quiz

## Description

- The goal of this project was to create a coding quiz
- It is a dynamic website where the user can click a button to start the quiz. They will have a set of coding questions to answer within a time limit of 75 seconds. At the end of the quiz, they will be able to input there initials and see their initials under "Highscores".
This project lets users test their coding knowledge by answering coding questions.
